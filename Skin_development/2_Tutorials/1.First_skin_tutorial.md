# 1 Details

Foundation is a very simple but fully functional skin designed to be used as either a base for creating new skins or as a learning tool for anyone interested in what makes a skin work.  

It comes with both 720p & 1080i coded XML's and also includes a screen shot folder of every window/dialog Kodi uses to make things even easier.  

To get the most out of it you'll need to either make a new keymap.xml or add this to your existing one   

```xml
<keymap>
    <global>
        <keyboard>
            <F5>XBMC.ReloadSkin()</F5>
            <F6>Skin.ToggleSetting(DebugGrid)</F6>
            <F7>Skin.ToggleSetting(HideDebugInfo)</F7>
            <F8>Notification(Testing 123,Hello world)</F8>
        </keyboard>
    </global>
</keymap>
```

# 2 Keys

The following keys will then activate the corresponding action   

```
F5 - Reload skin (used to see any changes instantly without restarting XBMC)
F6 - Show/Hide the Debug Grid (used for checking alignment, positioning, or sizing)
F7 - Show/Hide the Debug Info (used to display the currently active windows or dialogs)
F8 - Activated the KaiDialogToast.xml (used to display the notification dialog)
```
