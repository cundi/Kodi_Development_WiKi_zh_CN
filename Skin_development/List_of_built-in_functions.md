Skins can use built-in functions with the <onclick> or <onfocus> tag. Scripts can call built-in functions with xbmc.executebuiltin(function, block).  

The latest up-to-date list of built-in functions can be found in the source code files in [1].  

In addition to the following list, for most <onclick> and <onfocus> button actions in the skin you can also use the functions from Keyboard.xml.  

Example:  

```xml
<onclick>VolumeUp</onclick>
<onclick>VolumeDown</onclick>
```

You can use parameters with all media windows, as can be seen here:
